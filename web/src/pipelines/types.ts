// What a pipeline has to provide, and what the app shell does for it.
//
// The shell owns everything that is the same whatever science you are
// running: who you are, the file pickers, the submit-then-upload-then-
// poll sequence, the job list, the error handling. A pipeline owns the
// five things that are genuinely its own -- what files it takes, what
// controls it offers, what submit file it produces, how its results
// should be read, and what to run when the user has no data of their
// own.
//
// Three are implemented here, in pipelines/. They are worked examples,
// not a framework: a lab building their own deletes the two they do
// not want and edits the third. Nothing on the server knows this
// interface exists.

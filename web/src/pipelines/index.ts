// The pipelines this app offers.
//
// Adding one is adding a file here and a line below. Removing one is
// deleting the line -- nothing on the server knows which pipelines
// exist, so the queue keeps whatever is already running either way.
//
// Three worked examples, in increasing order of how much they ask of
// HTCondor:
//
//   wordfreq  one file in, one job, a structured result out
//   astro     many files in, one job each, binary output
//   blast     a large shared input and many queries, as a DAG
//
// Read wordfreq first. Read blast when you have an input every job
// needs and do not want to upload it per job.

 * compared the whole name against the pipeline id; it matched nothing

 * `substr` rather than `regexp`: the prefixes contain a dash, which is
 * harmless in a regex, but the next person to add a pipeline will use
 * a dot or a plus and find that it silently matches more than they
 * meant. A prefix comparison cannot do that.
 *
 * And `DAGManJobId is undefined`, which is what keeps a workflow to
 * ONE row. DAGMan passes its own -batch-name down to the node jobs it
 * submits, so a DAG's nodes carry the same JobBatchName as the manager
 * whether or not the node submit file sets one -- measured, not
 * assumed:
 *
 *   Cluster | JobBatchName    | DAGManJobId | Universe
 *   2       | blastdemo-probe | undefined   | 7  (scheduler: the manager)
 *   3       | blastdemo-probe | 2           | 5  (vanilla: a node)
 *   4       | blastdemo-probe | 2           | 5
 *
 * Without the clause a two-query BLAST search appears three times over
 * and looks like it was submitted repeatedly. The nodes are not this
 * page's jobs: the page submitted the workflow, DAGMan submitted the
 * nodes, and what they are doing belongs under the run that owns them
 * -- which is where blast's Results view reads it from.
